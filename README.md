Virtual TableTop (VTT) combined with a world building tool. Start with a demo collaborative paint as a prove of concept.

Python back, react front (made with Node)

Install:
1. Install python
2. To install dependencies, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To run the server, run `python back`

Steps 2 and 3 assume `python` refers to python3.8 or newer. Older python may work but I haven't tested with one.
